##  About Me  
I’m a first-year B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) student who learns the way most people breathe—  
constantly, quietly, and with a little bit of wonder tucked between lines of code.  

- 🌱 Currently exploring: Python, DSA, Machine Learning basics  
- 🎨 I design occasionally, write frequently, and dream constantly  
- 💻 I love building small projects that teach me big lessons  
- ✍️ Poetry, journaling & storytelling keep my creative side alive  
- 🌌 Goal: Become the version of me who creates things worth remembering
